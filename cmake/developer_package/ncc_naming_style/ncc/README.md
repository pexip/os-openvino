## ncc

C/C++ Naming convention checker (ncc)

ncc is a development tool to help programmers write C/C++ code that adheres to
a some naming conventions. It automates the process of checking C/C++ code to
spare humans of this boring (but important) task. This makes it ideal for
projects that want to enforce a coding standard.

## Dependencies

The following packages are pre-requisites for ncc tool. Note that, the python 'clang'
provides libclang python bindings. The clang version should match the libclang.so version on your system

* clang
* yaml

```python
pip install clang
pip install pyyaml
```

### Windows

On Microsoft Windows install install 32 bit version of LLVM compiler tool chain.

## Usage

```python
ncc.py [--help] [--recurse] [--style STYLE_FILE] [--cdbdir CDBDIR] [--dump]
       [--output OUTPUT] [--filetype FILETYPE] [--exclude EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]]
       [--path PATH [PATH ...]] [--include INCLUDE [INCLUDE ...]]
       [--definition DEFINITION [DEFINITION ...]] [--clang-lib CLANG_LIB]
```

For detailed description of all options:

```python
ncc.py --help
```

To print all rules:
```python
    ncc.py --dump
```

## Style Defintion

Style for c/c++ constructs are defined by regular expresssions. For e.g the below rules say that
a struct can have any character, a class name should begin with 'C', and a class member variable
should begin with m_, and a function name should begin with uppercase alphabet

```yaml
    ClassName: 'C.*'
    CppMethod: '[A-Z].*'
    VariableName:
        ScopePrefix:
            Global: 'g_'
            Static: 's_'
            ClassMember: 'm_'
        DataTypePrefix:
            String: 'str'
            Pointer: 'p'
            Integer: 'n'
            Bool: 'b'
        Pattern: '^.*$'
```

## Example Usage

### Check file test.cpp for naming convention violations:

```bash
    ./ncc.py --style examples/ncc.style --path examples/test.cpp

    examples/test.cpp:16:7: "B" does not match "^C.*$" associated with ClassName
    examples/test.cpp:28:9: "b" does not match "^m_.*$" associated with ClassMemberVariable
    examples/test.cpp:31:5: "main(int, const char **)" does not match "^[A-Z].*$" associated with FunctionName
    Total number of errors = 3
```

### Recursively find all files under 'examples' directory, but exclude '*.cpp' and '*.h' files

```bash
    ./ncc.py --style examples/ncc.style --recurse --exclude *.cpp *.h --path examples

    examples/test.hpp:4:7: "Test" does not match "^C.*$" associated with ClassName
    examples/test.hpp:12:9: "t" does not match "^m_.*$" associated with ClassMemberVariable
    examples/test.hpp:19:9: "_aaa" does not match "^[a-z].*$" associated with StructMemberVariable
    examples/test.c:8:9: "_b" does not match "^[a-z].*$" associated with StructMemberVariable
    examples/test.c:9:9: "_c" does not match "^[a-z].*$" associated with StructMemberVariable
    examples/tmp/test.hpp:4:7: "Test" does not match "^C.*$" associated with ClassName
    examples/tmp/test.hpp:12:9: "t" does not match "^m_.*$" associated with ClassMemberVariable
    examples/tmp/test.hpp:19:9: "_aaa" does not match "^[a-z].*$" associated with StructMemberVariable
    Total number of errors = 8
```
