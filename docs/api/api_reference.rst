API Reference
-------------

The OpenVINO toolkit has APIs available for Python, C, and C++. Most features exist for all APIs, but there are some differences. The C++ API is the most comprehensive.

There is also an nGraph API available for Python and C++, with enhanced operation sets and other features. Read `nGraph <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/ngraph.html>`_ and `Introduction to the nGraph <../openvino_docs_nGraph_DG_Introduction.html>`_ for more information.
