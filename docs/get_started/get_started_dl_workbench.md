# Quick Start with OpenVINO™ Toolkit via Deep Learning Workbench {#openvino_docs_get_started_get_started_dl_workbench}

The OpenVINO™ toolkit  is a comprehensive toolkit for optimizing pretrained deep learning models to achieve high performance and prepare them for deployment on Intel® platforms. Deep Learning Workbench (DL Workbench) is the OpenVINO™ toolkit UI designed to make the production of pretrained deep learning models significantly easier.

Start working with the OpenVINO™ toolkit right from your browser: import a model, analyze its performance and accuracy, visualize the outputs, optimize and prepare the model for deployment in a matter of minutes. DL Workbench will take you through the full OpenVINO™ workflow, providing the opportunity to learn about various toolkit components.

##  User Goals

* Learn what neural networks are, how they work, and how to examine their architectures with more than 200 deep learning models.
* Measure and interpret model performance right after the import​.
* Tune the model for enhanced performance.
* Analyze the quality of your model and visualize output.
* Use preconfigured JupyterLab\* environment to learn OpenVINO™ workflow.
